# Udemy Course Section 5(Pizza Menu Project Challenge)

This section mainly focus on Props, Components, JSX rules, using MAP to iterate an object array

I modified a bit using vite as my webpack then separating each components and data on folder, since on tutorial the file we are editing was on a single file only; so I decided to challenge myself to make it more neater and understand the concept of components and props better.
